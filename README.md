🍳 Recipe Finder App
📌 Overview

The Recipe Finder App is a React-based web application that allows users to search for recipes by ingredient or by recipe name. It fetches real-time data from TheMealDB API
 and displays the results with details such as ingredients, category, area, instructions, and images.

Users can also save favorite recipes to local storage, so their list is preserved even after refreshing the page.
